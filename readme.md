I started working through programming problems recently, when a confluence of changes in my life demanded a new way to sharpen the saw, so to speak. So here's a practice repo to commemorate my progress. I make no claims of performance or optimization. Many of these scripts are meant to illustrate concepts to a friend that is in bootcamp.
